            <h2>My Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Jack Schneiderhan. I'm currently a junior computer science major at Stevens. I'm from
                Hunterdon County, NJ, which is about an hour West of Hoboken. I love living in Hoboken because 
                of how close it is to New York City, along with Hoboken being a great place to be in itself. A 
                fun fact about me is that I just saw Dua Lipa in concert twice in one week. In addition to that,
                in two weeks, over Spring break, I'll be going to London right after my 21st birthday!
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of my family, at home, I live with my mom, dad, brother, and my dog, Henry. Henry is a
                labradoodle who we got last year, and he's very fluffy and loving. I'm taking Web Programming this
                semester because I would like to learn more about backend and frontend development when it comes 
                to designing my own website. I've enjoyed a lot about what I've learned so far and can't wait
                to work on the final project!
            </p>
