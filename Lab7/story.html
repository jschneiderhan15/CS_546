    <h1>That Time I Overreacted and Bought an iPad</h1>
    <main>
        <p>
            Last semester, when at work at Retro Fitness - I used to be a front desk worker at the local
            gym - I realized that classes were about to start and I didn't have any notebooks to take 
            any notes with. I usually bought notebooks before each semseter started in order to make sure
            that I was prepared for classes. However, since we were just about to start going to classes
            in person again, I wasn't used to needing notebooks! I wasn't sure what to do because I
            was pretty lazy and thought that going out to buy notebooks would both be a waste of my time,
            and also a waste of paper. After this realization, I went online to lookup some note taking
            alternatives.

            I knew that some of my friends had iPads to bring to classes to take notes and do homework with,
            but I never thought to buy my own because I didn't think I'd use it that much. However, I went on
            to apple.com to check out any deals they had available. To my luck, I found out that there were
            a lot of different deals for students like me! After a few hours of deliberation, I decided to buy
            an iPad under a student discount where I got a free pair of Airpods with it - which made buying
            a gift for my dad that year very easy. The same day I ordered the iPad, I actually went over to
            Manhattan to an Apple store to pick it up that night!

            After getting the iPad, I was looking at what apps I could get to enhance my experience at all. 
            I discovered a lot of different apps that I already had on my phone / laptop - such as Netflix - but
            I also found other apps that I'd never used before. One in particular is Procreate, which is an app
            that I use to draw on! I really like drawing and painting, so I'm glad I could find this application
            to utilize this hobby of mine. In terms of note taking, I also found a few notetaking apps that were 
            free, which was nice, because the iPad definitely was not a cheap purchase just for something to take
            notes on!

            In conclusion, if ever bored at work and think you need an iPad, I personally think one should go for it.
            While it definitely was a little expensive for a purchase just to take notes on, I'm glad I made the purchase
            overall because I use my iPad every day for other things, like drawing and watching Netflix. Whether or not
            this is extremely productive is definitely up in the air, but I use it enough to be satisfied!
